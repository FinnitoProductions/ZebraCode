# ZebraCode
Code which I documented for the zebra project in my expert systems class.

*NOTE*: I did not write the code in this project (it came from the JESS examples folder), but I simply documented it to more clearly define its function.

Finds and prints the solution to the Zebra problem using the rule engine's pattern-matching. First introduces the 
user to the problem, then generates all possible values for each fact type. If some combination of those values
triggers the solution-finding rule, the solution-finding rule will assert the solution facts, triggering a final rule 
to print the solution in a convenient table format.
